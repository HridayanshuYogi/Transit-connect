# Transit-connect
Currently, bus schedules are mostly available in printed or static formats, which do not reflect real-time conditions such as delays, traffic congestion, or route changes. Passengers often wait at bus stops without knowing the exact arrival time of buses, leading to inconvenience and loss of time. so this project will help to solve these problems
